# Welcome to the Sudoku-BoardGame

Its a Logical-Puzzle Board Game.

The Board is a Square of 9 Rows and 9 Columns, each Divided into 3 Blocks. Thus consisting of 3 Square Blocks of 3x3. 

In the Board, Out of 81 Boxes, some are Filled by Default. So other Boxes Need to Filled, by Putting Numbers from 1 to 9. 

However, the Challenge is that the Numbers could occur exactly once, in each Row, each Column, and each 3x3 Block. 
So All Rows, all Columns, and all Blocks must Contain all Numbers (1-9) without Repetition in any of them.
