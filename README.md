# Welcome to the Sudoku-BoardGame

Its a Logical-Puzzle Board Game.

The Board is Square of 9 Rows and Columns, each Divided into 3. 
Thus consisting of 9 Small Squares each of 3 Rows and Columns. 

We have to Put Individual non-repeatable Numbers from 1 to 9, on each Row, each Column, and each small Square. 

In this Way, filing up the Whole Board where the Numbers occur exactly once, in each Row, each Column, and each small Square.
